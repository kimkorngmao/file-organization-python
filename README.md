### File Organizer

This Python script (`fileOrganize.py`) organizes files in a given directory based on their file extensions.

#### How it Works

1. **Input**: You'll be prompted to enter the directory path where your files are located.
2. **Organization**: The script creates a new directory named `Organized` within the specified directory (if it doesn't exist already). It then sorts the files into subdirectories based on their file extensions.
3. **Output**: The organized files are moved into respective folders based on their file extensions within the `Organized` directory.

#### How to Use

1. Clone this repository or download the `fileOrganize.py` script.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where `fileOrganize.py` is located.
4. Run the script by typing `python fileOrganize.py` and follow the prompts to enter the directory path.

#### Note

- Ensure that you have Python installed on your system.
- This script does not handle subdirectories within the specified directory.
- If a file with the same name already exists in the destination directory, it will be overwritten.
